A github repository with code that I used to solve problems in MA-346-A-Numerical-Methods

I coded in MATLAB and honestly, none of the code is very good;  there are minimal comments and I challenged myself by coding in MATLAB, a language I still am not very fluent in.

The final project is the only thing relatively interesting.
